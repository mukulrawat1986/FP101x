I started the FP101x course on Edx when it first started but was not able to continue after the Monads chapter.
I have started the course again and will be finishing it to completion this time. There is a separate repository for it at github.com/mukulrawat1986/moocs/FP101x

Note: This repo does not contains the full course.
